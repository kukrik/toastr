# QCubed Toastr Plugin


## Toastr for QCubed v4

Toastr is a Javascript library for non-blocking notifications. jQuery is required. The goal is to create a simple core library that can be customized and extended.

Home page for the lib is https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr and demo is at

    composer require twbs/bootstrap
```
and

```
    composer require kukrik/toastr
```
